# Well, hello there....

I am Dom Cimafranca -- I like to think of myself as a programmer, writer, editor, and teacher.  
Throughout my career, I've done these and other roles.  Mostly I'm a *synthesizer* because I
bring in skills from multiple disciplines.  I dabble in Linux and Python, and that's much of
what you'll see here.
